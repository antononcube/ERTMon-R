This repository has an R implementation of the "**E**vent **R**ecords **T**ransformations **Mon**ad" (ERTMon) 
described in [AA1] and implemented with Mathematica in [AAp1].

## License matters

- The very first version of this package was released under GPL-3.

- Because of the considerations of the package use in the companies I worked I re-released it with BSD-3.

- At this point in time -- 2020-01-08 -- I do not see BSD-3 to be an adequate license for this work;
I think LGPL-3 is a better fit to all considerations. (Initial release, commercial use.)
